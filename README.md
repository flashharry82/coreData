Simple Example of CoreData in objective C using Xcode 4 for iOS 5
-----------------------------------------------------------------

I have tried to create the most simple example of the use of CoreData I can manage.
If you think you can make it simpler, please let me know.

Branches:

master - basic read from coreData memory, creates object on initialisation of results controller.   
feed - extends basic read to create objects pulled in from JSON feed done in viewDidLoad before results controller is initialised.
